# glowise
Glowing ores for Starbound's ISE-3 mod

Introduction
------------

Starbound's [Industrialization 3: Starbound Edition (ISE-3)](http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?resources/industrilization-3-starbound-edition-ise-3.2531/) mod by DraLUSAD _et al_ adds many functionalities into the game.
With one of those things come new ore (Tin) and various gemstones as mine-able tiles.

However, these tiles are unfortunately not affected by ore illumination mods, such as [Illuminated Ores](http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?resources/illuminated-ores.2429/) by Amadox.

Features
--------

This mod, glowise, illuminates the ores introduced by ISE-3. That's it.

Requirements
------------

You need ISE-3 to run this mod. You may want to get Illuminated Ores as well, because this mod does not illuminate vanilla ores, something Amadox (above) has already mastered.

Installation
------------

To clone with Git, go to your starbound/giraffe_storage/mod directory (or any directory that stores mods in your version), and then git clone this repository.

If you downloaded it as a ZIP, extract it in a way that you have a directory structure that has /starbound/giraffe_storage/mod/glowise/glowise.modinfo. It has to look like that or it won't work. I don't know how Github manages releases but I'll get around to do a .zip and .modpak releases whenever possible.

Issues
------

* Please recommend me with changes in parameters of each ISE-3 ore's glow. My taste in color (and my monitor) is not very good, so I'm working with what I feel good enough. If possible, please use Github's issues features or send a pull request.
* This mod is strategically named to exploit Starbound's reverse-alphabetic (or "descending", you terminology geeks) mod load ordering because the modinfo dependency system is not functioning properly. If Starbound changes the load ordering then this thing may break.

Compatibility
-------------

I develop this mod on nightly. It should work all the way down to stable. If it doesn't, please tell me.

Licensing
---------

As stated in the project page, ISE-3's author does not allow mod pack redistribution and asset modification. However, since this term does not discuss about *patching* the mod, I am currently in the process of permission request. That means, if it is denied, I will have to delete this repository. I hope nobody hasn't really downloaded this yet. *NO ENDORSEMENT OR AFFILIATION IS IMPLIED*

For my work in this mod, please treat this mod like other Starbound mods that have following as their copyright notice:

* Mod Pack Permissions: Anyone can use this mod in their mod compilation without the author's consent.
* Mod Assets Permissions: Anyone can alter/redistribute the mod's assets without the author's consent.

However, *attribution is required*.
